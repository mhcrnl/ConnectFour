ConnectFour
===========

Terminal-based version of Connect-Four
At the moment, the Main.cpp is set up to play human vs machine, with machine being described in the Solver.cpp.
A more dynamic and user-friendly version will be added soon.
Also, the graphics are kinda simple - upgrades welcome.
Apart from that, the game is working perfectly. You can play using the keys 1-7 on your keyboard.

Have fun and good luck.
